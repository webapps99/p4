## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a fully functioning web application. Using the skills I learned throughout the course, I created a Pet Services web application that uses PHP, Laravel and a MySQL database. The site incorporates web pages that demonstrate all 4 CRUD interactions as well as user signup and login.
